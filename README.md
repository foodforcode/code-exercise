## Demo (Public):
Navigate to the deployed [Stable Dashboard](https://stable-dashboard.herokuapp.com/) in your brower to view and demo the dashboard.

## Demo (Local):
> Note: This application was developed on a machine using an ARM processor, which may lead to unexpected issues during building on Linux/other systems.

### Pre-Installation requirements:
- Node.js (v16)
- npm (v6)
- Git (v2)

### Installation:
1. `git clone https://github.com/foodforcode/code-exercise.git`
2. `npm install` in your terminal to install all dependencies.
3. `npm start` in your terminal to start server.
4. `npm run react-dev` in separate terminal window to build bundle.

### View in browser:
Navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser to view and use dashboard

### Requirements:
1. âœ…  The web application resembles the provided mock ups

   *Note: Requirements state Noto Sans font, however mocks ups utilize IBM Plex Sans font*

   The web application is virtually indistinguishable from mocks ups.
   
   Bonus: Check out the tab for a familiar favicon!

2. âœ…  The web application is accessible from the public internet

   Deployed via Heroku: [Stable Dashboard](https://stable-dashboard.herokuapp.com/)  

3. âœ…  Users are able to view 6 mail items per page, with a maximum of 3 items per row

   The dashboard is limited to two rows of three mail items per page to view for a total of 6 items per page.

4. âœ…  Users can click through multiple pages when there are more than 6 mail items to display

   Next and previous buttons allow users to view additional pages when there are greater than 6 mail items.

5. âœ…  Users can easily interact with the web application in all screen sizes

   Reactstrap used for easy configuring of responsive components for different screen sizes. Mail gallery will re-arrange to optimize for user screen size.

6. âœ…  The mock mail item data provided in the data.json file is served to the frontend via an endpoint

   Mail data is served at the `/mail` endpoint via an Node/Express server.

7. âœ…  The codebase is pushed to a remote repository

   The codebase is hosted as a git repository on Github: [Source Code](https://github.com/foodforcode/code-exercise) 

### Architecture:
- Front end:

> React w/ hooks: A modern, popular front end framework used to create this Single Page Application that allows for seamless re-rendering of data without reloading. Hooks allow for the simple state management this project required, without use of additional libraries. React is fast and highly scalable.


> Reactstrap powered by Bootstrap: A toolkit for building mobile-first sites with responsive components. Provides increased accesibility which is a standard and requirement. Great for getting this mvp completed in a timely manner and keep components uniform. Easily integrates with Sass.


> Axios: A promise-based library for making HTTP requests and handling responses.


> Moment: A simple library used to convert the Unix timestamp in provided data, to the Month, DD, YYY format. (Deprecated; an oldie but a goodie.)


- Back end:
> Node/Express server: A powerful, lighweight, non-blocking server to handle requests incoming HTTP request for mail and server static assests. Highly scalable to serve other data and make third party API or database requests.


> Nodemon: A utility used for ease in development by restarting application upon file changes. Efficient for viewing changes during development.


- Build tools:


> Webpack: This webpack is a custom configuration for this dashboard application, chosen over Create React App for customizabization and scalability. Webpack with Babel is used as a compiler and transpiler and bundler to allow browers to read code written in jsx as js in one convenient but large bundle. Can easily be configured for the addition of Sass and other libraries as needed during scaling.

> Heroku: Integrates with Github for automatic deployments.
